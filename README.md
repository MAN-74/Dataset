We chose a topic about housing prices because of its great importance and direct impact on individuals and the economy. The real estate market is constantly changing, and analyzing the factors that affect home prices can provide valuable insights for buyers, sellers, and investors. Through **data mining**, we can use big data to extract useful information, predicting how the prices of various properties will grow or will not change by examining their different features.
