    "## Housing Prices Predictions\r",
    "## \n",
    "## Motivation:\r\n",
    "We chose a topic about housing prices because of its great importance and direct impact on individuals and the economy. The real estate market is constantly changing, and analyzing the factors that affect home prices can provide valuable insights for buyers, sellers, and investors. Through **data mining**, we can use big data to extract useful information, predicting how the prices of various properties will grow or will not change by examining their different features. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Problem:\r\n",
    "Our project focuses on predicting how the prices of various properties will change by examining their different features. We aim to provide useful information that will help both consumers and realtors understand whether property prices are likely to rise, or stay the same based on the specific characteristics of each property.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
